# Overview
In this project we were tasked with writing code that demonstrated basic abilities through javascript to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) vocabulary words pulling from a database, creating on site and then storing in a persistant databse. Users may authenticate upon login so only their vocabulary word data may be viewed, created, read, updated, deleted or stored for later use.
